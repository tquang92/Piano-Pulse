    <h1>Lessons 1: Piano Chord Progressions</h1>
    <p>
      A chord progression is a series of chords put together in a pattern. In the beginning of the video, I play a chord progression in the key of F. That progression is F, B flat, C, B Flat, and back to F.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chord progressions are based around piano scales , so when I say the song is in the key of F, I mean that its chords are based on the F major scale. F is the root of the scale, B flat is the fourth note of the scale and C is the fifth note of the chord. Because of this we can say that F is the I chord, B flat is the IV chord, and C is the V chord. These three chords are the most popular chords in modern music. A lot of the songs you hear on the radio are written with just those three chords, although in a variety of keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play around with the chords on your keyboard. You can put them in any order you like. For variety you can pick out individual notes of the chord instead of playing the whole thing at once. You can also play around with the pattern in which you play those individual notes of the chords, or play around with different inversions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's build a different set of chords from a new key to help you fully grasp the concept. I'm going to use the key of E major. The root of the E major scale is E. Next let's hit the II chord, based on the second note of the scale, F sharp minor. From there let's play the V chord, a B chord. Now let's return to the E chord for a couple of measures. Another chord we haven't used yet is the VI chord. The sixth note of the E major scale is a C sharp, so let's play a measure with a C sharp chord. From there let's go to the IV chord, which is an A chord, to the V chord, back to the root chord of E.x

      <h1>Lesson 2: Counting Notes on Piano</h1>
      <h2>1. Counting Whole Notes on Piano</h2>
      <div>
        Whole notes, as they relate to 4/4 time, also known as common time. In 4/4 time there are four
        beats per measure. A whole note, as the name implies, takes up a whole measure.
      </div>
      <div>
        To understand the proper way to play a whole note, start your metronome. Hit a key on a click of
        the metronome and hold it for four clicks. On the fifth click, a new measure is starting and you
        should play the note again. Remember that the click that you start on counts as one click. So it
        goes: note click click click, note click click click, note click click click, etc.
      </div>
      <p>
        Keep playing whole notes, holding them for four clicks and repeating on the fifth click until you
        have a feel for whole notes.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Counting Quarter Notes on Piano</h2>
      <div>
        Quarter notes are the basis of 4/4 time, also known as common time. In 4/4 time there are four
        beats per measure. A quarter note represents one beat in 4/4 time, so there are four quarter notes
        per measure.<br />
        To get a feel for quarter notes, start your metronome. Hit a key on a click of the metronome and
        play it again on each click of the metronome. Every four times you play the note, you are playing
        a complete measure.<br />
        Keep playing quarter notes for a while to get a firm grasp of it. Since they are the basis of 4/4
        time, quarter notes will be used a lot while learning to play rhythm. The count may be doubled to
        make eighth notes, or cut in half to make half notes. It may be altered even further, making whole
        notes or sixteenth notes. Either way the base of the time signature is quarter notes.
      </div>

      <h2>3. Counting Half Notes on Piano</h2>
      <div>
        Half notes as they relate to 4/4, or common, time. In common time, there are four quarter note
        beats per measure. If you turn on your metronome and play one note per click, you are playing
        quarter notes. <br />
        Since a half note lasts for twice as long as a quarter note, then you should play one note every
        two beats of the metronome in order to play half notes. There are two half notes in a measure of
        4/4 time.

      <h1>Lesson 3: How To Read Sheet Music</h1>
      <div>
        Learning how to play piano by ear and apply it to what you see on a keyboard is a lot easier if you can read notes. Being able to read sheet music allows you to visualize what you are hearing and translate it to the piano more effectively.
      </div>
      <div>
        In order to learn to read sheet music we are going to go back to our old friend, Middle C. Piano music has two sets of horizontal lines. These are called staffs. The vertical lines that break up the staffs are called bar lines, and the segments that they make up are called measures. The top of the two staffs is called the Treble Clef, and represents all of the notes above Middle C. The bottom of the two staffs is called the Bass Clef, and represents all of the notes below Middle C.
      </div>
      <div>
        Because Middle C divides the staffs, it is obvious that the note in the very middle of the two is Middle C. Let's move up to the bottom line of the treble clef. A note on this line is an E. As we move up the lines of the staff the notes represented are G, B, D, and F. Those are the notes that are on the lines of the treble clef. You can remember the order by using the phrase [E]very [G]ood [B]oy [D]eserves [F]udge. The notes that fall in between the lines of the staff are the notes that fall between its notes. Between the E and G lines is an F, between the G and B lines is an A, between the B and D lines is a C, and between the D and F lines is an E. It is easy to remember the notes that fall in between the lines because they are F, A, C, E. They spell a familiar word. So you know to remember the treble clef you need the phrase “every good boy deserves fudge” and the word “face”. Now I'm going to show you how to read the bass clef.
      </div>
      <div>
        As I mentioned earlier the bass clef is made up of all of the notes below Middle C. Let's go ahead and start at the very last line on the bass clef, like we did for the treble clef. That bottom note on the bass clef is G. As the lines go up the staff the notes are B, D, F, A. We can remember the names of the notes on the bass clef's staff lines by changing the phrase from the treble clefs lines a little. The phrase for the bass clef is [G]ood [B]oys [D]eserve [F]udge [A]lways. Like the treble clef, we can simply use the C major scale to find the remaining notes on the bass clef. In between G and B is A, between B and D is C, between D and F is E, and between F and A is G. These notes, A, C, E, G, don't spell a word like face, but we can use another phrase to remember them. Something like [A]ll [C]ows [E]at [G]rass. Now you know how to read most of the notes on a piece of sheet music, but what about sharps and flats?
      </div>
      <div>
        Say we wanted to make a G sharp. We would put the note on the staff and beside it we would place the symbol for sharp, which looks similar to the symbol for number, #. To indicate that a note is a flat, we do something very similar, using the symbol for a flat. A flat is represented by a symbol that looks a lot like a lowercase b. You can see it in the video, or will likely run across it in much of the sheet music you may encounter.

      <h1>Lesson 4: Reading Chord Charts For Piano</h1>
      <div>
        Chord charts are also called lead sheets. For this lesson, I am going to assume that you know how
        to build chords, be they triads, sevenths, etc.
      </div>
      <div>
        In normal sheet music, you will see the chord written as individual notes on the staff. A chord
        chart just has the name of the chord written above the staff. Simple major triads are simple, they
        are just written as the name of the chord, for example C. A major seventh chord is written one of
        two ways, either with a Maj7 beside it (CMaj7) or a triangle beside it. Both of them mean the same
        thing, there are just two styles of writing it. A dominant seventh chord is written with just the
        seven beside it, for example G7.
      </div>
      <div>
        A lowercase m beside the chord means that it is a minor chord. For example Dm is D minor, and Dm7
        is a D minor seventh chord. A suspended chord can be written several ways, depending on which note
        is suspended. You may see something like Csus, Csus4, or even Csus2-4. In order to really grasp a
        chord chart, you have to understand intervals and how chords are built up.
      </div>
      <div>
        If you have a C dominant seventh chord with a ninth added it is notated C9. A C chord with just
        the added ninth is written Cadd9. A C major seventh chord with the ninth added is written CMaj9.
        An augmented chord is written with a plus sign behind it. You may see C+, or C+7. A diminished
        chord is written one of two ways, either Cdim or with a little circle behind it that looks like
        the symbol for a degree.

      <h1>Lesson 5: Basic Piano Time Signatures</h1>
      <div>
        The most common time signature is 4/4. In fact it is so common that it is also referred to as common time. But what does 4/4 time mean? It means that there are four measures, and four beats in a measure. The number on top is the number of measures, and the number on the bottom can be thought of as a fraction. In this case it equals 1/4 notes.
      </div>
      <div>
        Another popular time signature is 3/4 time. Taking what we have learned we will see that this time signature has 3 quarter notes in each measure. This time signature is most famous for its use in waltzes.
      </div>
      <div>
        Yet another popular time signature is 6/8. So there are 6 beats per measure and each beat is played as eighth notes. The trick with 6/8 times is that it often sounds like two separate triplets in each measure. If you watch the video, you'll hear what I mean.
      </div>
      <div>
        There are other time signatures too. 7/8 has seven beats in a measure and each is an eighth note. There's 9/4, 12/4, 2/4, and even 4/2 time. That last one isn't so common, but consists of four beats in a measure with each one being a half note.

      <h1>Lesson 6: Understanding Piano Rests</h1>
      <div>
        In music, there are always spaces in what you are playing. Those spaces are called rests.
      </div>
      <div>
        Let's look at an example in 4/4 time. In that time signature, there are four beats per measure. So if I play a measure of quarter notes it would be: note, note, note, note. But lets say there is a rest in there. It would look more like: note, note, no note, note. That space where there is no note is the rest. In that measure there are 3 quarter notes, and 1 quarter rest.
      </div>
      <div>
        We can do the same things with eighth notes and eighth note rests, sixteenth notes and sixteenth note rests, and on and on. The length of the space, or the rest, is the same as it would be if you were actually playing a note.
      </div>
      <div>
        Just like notes, rests have a different look depending on what their duration is. You can watch the video to see what each rest notation looks like. Listening to me play in the video will also help you get a grasp on the concept if you are having difficulty.

      <h1>Lesson 7: Understanding Piano Intervals</h1>
      <div>
        What is an interval, you ask? An interval is the space between two notes. Let's take a look at the C Major scale to illustrate what I mean. The distance between the C and the D in the C Major scale is a second. D is the second note in the scale. Follow same logic and you'll find that C to E is a third, C to F is a fourth, C to G is a fifth, C to A is a sixth, C to B is a seventh, and C to the next C is an eighth. An interval of an eighth is also called an octave.
      </div>
      <div>
        Now you know all of the major intervals of the C Major scale, but what about the sharps and the flats? Let's take a look at those intervals now. I said previously that the interval between the C and the D is a second. Let's take that a step further and call it a major second. If you look at the keyboard, you'll realize that there is a black key in between the C and the D keys, the D flat key. This interval is not quite a full, or major second, so we call it a minor second. The same goes for the interval between C and E.
      </div>
      <div>
        There is a black key right before the E key. If the E key is a major third, we can call the black key directly before it, the E flat key, the minor third.
      </div>
      <div>
       Ok, so I've told you what happens when we go down a partial interval. What happens when the black key goes up a partial interval? This very thing happens at the F key. The interval between C and F is a fourth. The F sharp key is what we call an augmented fourth. Augmented simply means that it is slightly above a perfect fourth. That same key can also be called a diminished fifth. This is because the note is just as close the the perfect fifth as it is to the perfect fourth. In the case of the fifth, the note is lower than perfect, or diminished.
      </div>
      <div>
        This logic can be applied all the way throughout the scale. The A flat key is a minor sixth right before the major sixth made by the A key. The A flat key can also be called an augmented fifth, because it is right after the perfect fifth. If the interval between C and B is a major seventh, it stand to reason that the interval between C to B flat is a minor seventh.
      </div>
      <div>
        This can all seem a bit overwhelming at first, and I'll go into more depth with it in later lessons. For now, I strongly encourage you to re-watch the video or re-read the text as much as necessary to get at least a basic grasp on intervals. Intervals are not only very important building blocks of chords, but a greater knowledge of intervals and how they relate to one another will have a profound impact on your ability to create melodies or play them by ear.

        Glissando is a fancy way of saying that you are playing all of the notes of the white keys in quick succession. You have heard it in some of those rockabilly songs. Here is the proper way to do it. Coming down the keys, use the back of your thumb. It will hurt a little bit at first, but as you get used to it the pain stops. Coming up the other way you use the back of your middle finger.
      </div>
      <div>
        So now that you know how to play it, where do you put it in a song? Well, you've got to feel that. It can be used anytime you are approaching a chorus, or building up to something, or really anytime you really just want to dig in there and rock out. Just be sure not to use it too often. Any embellishment that is played to often can ruin an otherwise good song.

        This song is in the key of F. The basic riff that starts off the song is based on a D note in the left hand and an F major in the second inversion in the right hand. This combination gives us a D minor seventh. All the left hand does is pound away at eighth notes. While the left hand is doing this, the right hand plays quarter notes. The second note is B flat. At the end of the section with the B flat, you'll move up the pinky of the right hand to hit a C note. You can see what I mean but watching me play in the video. The third note is an F in the left hand, with an F major in the right. He plays that for a while before switching to a C suspended chord in the right hand, and the left hand still on the F. Now the pattern repeats itself a bit, going back to the D minor, then B flat, F and finally ending on A.
      </div>
      <div>
        As a solo piano piece, we aren't going to keep playing that all the way throughout the song, although on the recording that is exactly what he does. WIthout a band and vocals to back us up, we need to play the melody line ourselves. The melody is based around the F triad. Use my playing in the video, and the skills you've learned for picking out melodies to see if you can teach yourself this melody.

        This is a relatively simple song in the key of B, but it does take practice to play it at speed. The left hand pretty much plays the same three notes for much of the song. The three notes of the left hand are E F# and D#. Those three notes make a little riff, which you'll hear when you listen to me (or Vanessa) play it.
      </div>
      <div>
        The right hand intro for the song is a simple riff based on rocking back and forth between the B and the B octave. Sandwiched in between these octave jumps are a few notes based on the B major scale. Watch me play to see the notes, or listen to Vanessa play, and see if you can pick out the notes with your ear. We've done a lot of ear training on simple melodies in previous lessons, and this is a great opportunity to take that one step further.
      </div>
      <div>
        When the song gets to the verse, she pretty much plays the same melody, and left hand riff pattern, except she stops the rocking motion between the B and the B octave. The result is a sound that is very similar to the intro, but less busy and more sparse.
      </div>
      <div>
        The chorus is simple comparatively to what we've been doing. She basically just plays three chords, E, G# minor, and F#. She plays the E and the G# minor each three times quickly then ends with an F# chord held longer. Do that three times, listening to me or the recording for the proper timing. After those three times the song goes back into the same chords we've been playing.
